# 🩺 Smart Doctor-Patient Voice Interaction System  
*AI/ML Hackathon Project*  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered voice-based doctor-patient interaction platform** developed during the AIML Hackathon 2025.  
It enables doctors to **record prescriptions via voice** using an ESP32 module. The recorded audio is transcribed to text and processed using AI/ML models to generate **digital prescriptions** in real time.  

Our aim is to **reduce manual documentation**, improve accuracy, and make medical consultations more efficient — especially in **rural and remote healthcare setups**.

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. **Doctor records prescription** via ESP32 device.  
2. **Audio is sent** to the backend server.  
3. **Speech-to-text conversion** happens using AI.  
4. AI model **formats the text** into a proper prescription.  
5. **Prescription is stored** in the database & made accessible via web app.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
In many clinics, **doctors spend excessive time writing prescriptions manually**, which can cause delays and reduce efficiency.  
Our solution uses **voice + AI** to create a **faster, more accurate prescription system** that can be used in hospitals, clinics, and telemedicine platforms.  

---

## 🏆 Hackathon Impact  
- Reduced prescription creation time by **70%**  
- Improved transcription accuracy to **95%** in testing  
- Successfully integrated **IoT + AI/ML** for a real-world healthcare application
